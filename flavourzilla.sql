It should only take about 15-20 minutes for your rice to finish cooking. Heat your vinegar, sugar, and salt together in a small saucepan. Add 2.5 tablespoons (37 mL) of rice vinegar, ½ tablespoon of granulated white sugar, and ½ teaspoon of salt to the saucepan and place it on the stove over low heat. These ingredients will serve as the seasoning mixture for your sushi rice. Warm the mixture for 2-3 minutes, stirring it occasionally to prevent it from scorching', 'Add your seasoning mixture to the cooked rice and let it cool. Drizzle the vinegar, sugar, and salt over your freshly-cooked rice while it\'s still warm. Stir the rice thoroughly for 1-2 minutes to ensure that the seasoning mixture is fully incorporated throughout. When you\'re done, leave your rice out on the countertop to cool at room temperature.', 'Cut your filling ingredients into small pieces. Slice veggies like cucumber, avocado, and daikon sprouts into thin slivers to make sure they\'ll fit in your roll comfortably. If you want to incorporate fresh fish, shrimp, eel, or any other type of seafood, you can either cut it into strips or opt for a finer chop, dice, or mince. You\'ll only need about 2 ounces (57 g) of veggies or fish (or both) to fill your sushi roll.', 'Place a sheet of nori on your rolling mat with the shiny side down. The nori is an essential component of any sushi roll—it serves as both the base and wrapper for your roll. Nori is quite delicate, so handle it gently to avoid accidentally crinkling or tearing it while removing it from its packaging. Wet your fingers to keep the rice from sticking to them as you work. Hold your hands under a stream of cool water, then shake off the excess moisture. It may also be a good idea to keep a bowl of clean water next to your work area if you\'re going to be putting together more than one roll.', '\r\nSpread a thin layer of sushi rice onto the sheet of nori. Grab ¾-1 cup (140-190 g) of rice and place it in the center of the sheet. Pat the rice down gently with the flat of your fingers until it\'s evenly distributed over the surface of the nori. Leave about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of empty space at the top of the nori—this will allow it to close once it\'s been rolled. Make a shallow depression near the bottom of the rice with your finger. Press your entire pointer finger into the rice in a straight line widthwise across the bottom third of the nori. The idea is to hollow out a slender area to make sure your ingredients will fit and prevent them from spilling out over the nori once you begin rolling.', 'Add roughly 2 ounces (57 g) of filling ingredients to the rice. Take about ⅓ of a cup of sliced veggies, fish, and other ingredients of choice and arrange them in a line in the depression you made along the lower part of the rice. Again, avoid overfilling your roll, as this could cause it to rupture or make it hard to close. Roll the sushi up from the bottom using your mat as a guide. Slide your thumbs under the lower edge of your mat and gently lift it up and forward to fold the bottom of the nori over on itself. Once you\'ve done this, continue pulling the mat forward slowly, applying light pressure to help mold the roll until it closes.', 'Wet a sharp knife with cool water. Just like you wet your fingers before building your roll, it\'s important to wet your knife before you cut it. Dip the blade of your knife into a container of water, or run it under the tap from tip to handle. A dry blade is more likely to mangle than make a clean cut. The last thing you want is to make a mess of your roll after spending so much time getting it just right. Cut your roll into 1–2 in (2.5–5.1 cm) pieces. For standard hosomaki rolls, each piece should be about 1 in (2.5 cm) wide. Chumaki rolls can be slightly bigger at around 1.5 inches (3.8 cm), while futomaki (the largest type of hand-rolled sushi) pieces may be up to 2–2.5 inches (5.1–6.4 cm) wide.', 'Cuisine', 'Japanese', 'XYZ', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/aDQxH-KpCCc', 23, 12),
